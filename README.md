# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Pokemon Battle Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A simulator that shows who would win within a given input.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So the project should have multiple layers. The first would have a list of a few (a designated number) that the user would choose from. The user would input a two numbers/names (undecided which) which would then list a bit of information of the pokemon that corrolates with it. It would also show images of the pokemon and who would win if the two fought. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

User would be able to input at least one number/name and information will appear.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

User would be able to input at least one number/name and picture with information will appear.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

User would be able to input two numbers/names and picture with information will appear then the winner would be stated.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would have to look into how to get an image to appear throughout the code. Luckily, I have extensive knowledge of the pokemon would, so not much resaeach will havr to go into it for that end. I also hope that my groupmates is be able to tackle some of the coding process with I put my knowledge of the topic to good use.
